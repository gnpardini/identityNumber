The calculation of the letter of the National Identity Document (DNI) is a simple mathematical process that is based on obtaining the rest of the whole division of the DNI number and the number 23. From the rest of the division, the letter is obtained. selecting it from an array of letters.

The array of letters is:

var letters = ['T', 'R', 'W', 'A', 'G', 'M', 'Y', 'F', 'P', 'D', 'X', 'B ', 'N', 'J', 'Z', 'S', 'Q', 'V', 'H', 'L', 'C', 'K', 'E', 'T'] ;
Therefore, if the rest of the division is 0, the letter of the DNI is T and if the rest is 3, the letter is A. With these data, create a small script that:

1 Store in a variable the DNI number indicated by the user and in another variable the letter of the DNI that has been indicated.

2 First (and in a single statement) you must check if the number is less than 0 or greater than 99999999.

3 If the number is valid, the corresponding letter is calculated according to the method explained above.

4 Once the letter is calculated, it must be compared with the letter indicated by the user. If they do not match, a message is displayed to the user telling them that the letter they entered is not correct. In another case, a message is displayed indicating that the ID number and letter are correct.
